        [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/wdm0006/pygeohash/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github)](https://coveralls.io/github/wdm0006/pygeohash?branch=master)  ![travis status](https://travis-ci.org/wdm0006/pygeohash.svg?branch=master) 
        
        Pygeohash is a Python module that provides functions for decoding and encoding geohashes to and from latitude and 
        longitude coordinates, and doing basic calculations and approximations with them.
        
        It is based off of Leonard NorrgÃ¥rd's [geohash](https://github.com/vinsci/geohash) module, but aims to add more 
        functionality while supporting python 3 as well.
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        To use pygeohash:
        
            import pygeohash as pgh
            
            pgh.encode(42.6, -5.6)
            # >>> 'ezs42e44yx96'
            
            pgh.encode(42.6, -5.6, precision=5)
            # >>> 'ezs42'
            
            pgh.decode('ezs42')
            # >>> ('42.6', '-5.6')
            
            pgh.geohash_approximate_distance('bcd3u', 'bc83n')
            # >>> 625441
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Pygeohash has no requirements outside of the python stdlib, and aims to keep it that way if at all possible. To install:
        
            pip install pygeohash
